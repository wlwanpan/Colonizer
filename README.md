Colonizer serves as an asset manager, trading platform and voting tool.
The goal is to improve marginal productivity of capital and allow for a community driven governance.

Colony:

- Upon reaching a consensus of majority, the proposal is either declared settled or archieved.
- Acting against a settled law will deduct the habitants' penalty score.
